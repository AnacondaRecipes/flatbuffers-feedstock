  summary: FlatBuffers is an efficient cross platform serialization library.
  description: |
    FlatBuffers is an efficient cross platform serialization library for C++, C#, C, Go, Java, 
    JavaScript, PHP, Python, and more. It was originally created at Google for game development 
    and other performance-critical applications. FlatBuffers allows you to directly access 
    serialized data without parsing/unpacking it first, while still having great forwards/backwards 
    compatibility. It provides both memory efficiency and speed by allowing direct access to the 
    serialized data, and supports zero-copy deserialization.
